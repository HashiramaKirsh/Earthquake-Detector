# Earthquake Detector

## Overview
This project involves building an earthquake detector using a Raspberry Pi 4 and an SW-420 sensor. The detector employs machine learning algorithms to identify P-waves and S-waves, and sends push notifications to a mobile device.

## Components
- Raspberry Pi 4
- SW-420 Sensor
- Python 3.x
- PyCharm for development
